Minimal Go stack (updated)

  - Go 1.22
  - gRPC: grpc-go
  - Codegen: buf (protos + breaking/linters)
  - REST/OpenAPI: grpc-gateway + protoc-gen-openapiv2
  - Telemetry: OpenTelemetry (traces + metrics)
  - Logs: Loki + Grafana
  - DB: MongoDB
  - Cache: Redis
  - Secrets: Vault + External Secrets Operator
  - K8s: vanilla manifests + HPA


# i need to discuss file structure for the new repo

keep it (recommended minimal path)

  - React + Vite + Tailwind stays exactly the same.
  - It talks to the REST API exposed by grpc-gateway.
  - Only change needed: update the base API URL and any field names if your proto/JSON differs.

  Why keep TS frontend?

  - Faster UI iteration than Go web templates.
  - Keeps the project structure familiar and already matches your use case.
  - Go backend is orthogonal to the frontend; you just swap the gateway implementation.

  Optionally modernize

  - Generate TypeScript clients from OpenAPI:
      - Use openapi-typescript or openapi-generator to avoid hand‑written API wrappers.
  - That way your frontend stays type‑safe even as proto changes.
